# Gym-Location-Models

**Gym-Location-Models** is a personal research playground for experimenting with machine learning models in the **location intelligence domain** during my own time. This repository serves as a sandbox for implementing, testing, and comparing, next POI prediction, and spatio-temporal modeling.

---

## üéØ Project Overview

This repository contains experimental implementations and research explorations in location intelligence, focusing on:

- **Sequential modeling** for next POI prediction using Transformer architectures
- **Multi-modal embeddings** combining POI, temporal, and spatial features
- **Spatio-temporal modeling** for trajectory analysis with attention mechanisms
- **Language models** adapted for location sequences (GPT-2 for shop sequences)
- **Synthetic data generation** for mobility patterns with realistic constraints

## üéØ Experimental Learning Goals

**Note**: This repository is strictly for experimental learning purposes and is not intended for production use. The following objectives represent educational explorations in location intelligence and predictive modeling:

### 1. **Foot-Traffic Projection**
Implemented a Prophet model with a focus on seasonality analysis to predict quarterly foot traffic for major retail chains. This experiment explores time-series forecasting techniques and seasonal pattern recognition in retail analytics.

### 2. **Sales Forecasting** 
Developed custom predictive ML models tailored to each client's industry, metrics, and data, predicting sales for new stores across the United States based on location characteristics. This research focuses on location-based feature engineering and industry-specific modeling approaches.

### 3. **Marketing Research**
Conducted a study on the incremental lift effect of billboard signs on visitation during marketing campaigns. The project's challenge involved defining and identifying a reliable control group for comparison with the exposed group. This experiment explores causal inference methodologies in location-based marketing analytics.

> **Disclaimer**: All implementations are experimental proof-of-concepts designed for learning and research purposes only. They are not optimized, validated, or suitable for production environments.
